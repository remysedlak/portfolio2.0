            <p className="text-xl mb-2 ">
                I'm passionate about building software that empowers creativity and exploration. Whether it's experimenting with workflows or designing intuitive interfaces, I love pushing the boundaries of what's possible with code and machines.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2 text-xl">
                When I'm not coding, you can usually find me hanging out with my cat, who is always curious about my latest projects (and sometimes walks across my keyboard).
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2 text-xl">
                I have a deep fascination with systemsâ€”how things work, how they connect, and how they can be improved. This curiosity drives me to explore scripting and automation, making workflows smoother and more efficient.
            </p>

                Thanks for stopping by and learning a bit about me!

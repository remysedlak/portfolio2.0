                Hi, I'm Remy Sedlak,
                I'm passionate about building music software that empowers creativity and exploration. Whether it's experimenting with new sounds or designing intuitive interfaces, I love pushing the boundaries of what's possible with code and music.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
                When I'm not coding, you can usually find me hanging out with my cat, who is always curious about my latest projects (and sometimes walks across my keyboard).
            </p>
            <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
                I have a deep fascination with systemsâ€”how things work, how they connect, and how they can be improved. This curiosity drives me to explore scripting and automation, making workflows smoother and more efficient.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-md font-semibold">
                Thanks for stopping by and learning a bit about me!
            </p>
